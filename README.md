# firn
A calm, minimalist desktop browser built on Electron and Chromium. Vertical tabs with room to breathe, pinned tabs, spaces, glance previews, and split view. Inspired by Arc and Zen, named after settled alpine snow. firnbrowser.com

## Running Firn on your computer

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (the LTS version) and Git installed once.

```
git clone https://github.com/dwurgy/firn.git
cd firn
npm install      # first time only, and whenever package.json changes
npm start        # opens Firn
```

**Windows: if PowerShell says "running scripts is disabled on this system"**, run this once and answer `Y`:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

(Or use `npm.cmd install` / `npm.cmd start` instead.)

`npm start` runs Firn in development mode: if you change a file in `src/ui/`, the window updates by itself. For changes to `src/main.ts` or `src/preload.ts`, type `rs` in the terminal and press Enter to restart.

### Shortcuts (so far)

### Where things live

- `src/main.ts` — the main process: creates the window, handles shortcuts and messages from the UI.
- `src/tabs.ts` — the tab manager: the list of tabs and the web page behind each one.
- `src/types.ts` — the data model (spaces, tabs, window) shared by every part of the app.
- `src/preload.ts` — the narrow, safe bridge between Firn's UI and the main process.
- `src/ui/` — Firn's own interface (React): the sidebar and tabs (`App.tsx`), the command bar and tab switcher that float over the page (`Floating.tsx`).
- `src/url.ts` — decides whether what you typed is an address or a search.
